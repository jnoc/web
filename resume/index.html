        <h5>SEPT 2018 - JUNE 2022 <span class="colour">/</span> Portsmouth <span class="colour">/</span> First year average (1st) & Second year average (2:1)</h5>
        <p>Since enrolled I have encountered a number of challenging tasks;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Started out not knowing how to program going into the course. Before christmas of 2018 was able to write modules and classes in python which helped grasp <u>object orientated</u> programming. Java was learnt towards the middle of the first year.</li>
            <li>Developed a pizza ordering system <u>independently</u> with Java to a specific specification that takes a users input and outputs a detailed result that would show a single items information. Whilst being able to add, delete or edit an item. My work met the specification.</li>
            <li>Worked as a team to design a working adder/subtractor machine with <u>computer logic</u>. As a team we discussed and mocked up ideas to identify assets that we took forward to solve the task. We constructed a working machine was able to add or subtract numbers in binary form like how a computer would.</li>
            <li>Wrote an academic <u>literature review</u> around a relevant title that was given to us. This involved  discovery and research around the area whilst referencing in APA 6th to back up and solidify the text. The review was marked a 2:1.</li>
            <li>Again worked within a group to analyze and create a network design and pitch for a festival. Was assigned the <u>project leader</u> and managed what people did to contribute whilst working on my own sector. As a group we pitched our network idea in front of mock clients which met all the requirements.</li>

            <li>Within this week, I marked up an HTML front web page with <u>Bootstrap</u> to very specific requirements directly from a mockup image, as well as programming a bursary calculator in <u>PHP</u> which as a language I was not familiar with. I completed both of these tasks and the backend PHP code is being used by the firm to deliver a product to the client.</li>

        <h2><i class="fas fa-mountain"></i>Hobbies and Interests<span class="colour">.</span></h2>
        <h4><u>Skiing</u></h4>
        <p>My long time passion has been skiing, first started out when I was 4 and then returned to it around the age of 13. I have around 7 weeks of being physically on the snow whilst being taught via instructors and love the atmosphere of being free to glide down the slope. I have skied in resorts such as Zell am Ziller, Kaltenbach, Mayrhofen, Hochfügen (Austria) and Bansko (Bulgaria).</p>
        <h4><u>Photography</u></h4>
        <p>When I can, I will take my camera with me on my travels. I enjoy taking photos of landscapes rather than people. Most of the techniques that I use when capturing photos has come from my A-Level course and practice. Some places that I have captured images of include; London, Kew, Bansko (Bulgaria), Lake District, Chamonix (France).</p>
        <h4><u>Camping / Outdoors</u></h4>
        <p>At a young age I was introduced to camping, it has been a part of how I think since then. I joined the local scout troop and would go camping at every opportunity that arose. I try to have some form of trip within the year on weekends where I go out of my way to either go on a hike or a journey that involves the use of a tent. I have walked up both Scafell pike and Pen y Fan along with camping in England and Wales.</p>
