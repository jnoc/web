        <h4><u>University of Portsmouth</u> <span class="colour">-</span> <em>First in BSc (Hons) Computer Science</em></h4>
        <h5>SEP 2018 - JUN 2022 <span class="colour">/</span> Portsmouth <span class="colour">/</span> UK</h5>
        <p>My final year <a href="https://github.com/jnoc/PJE40-R">research project</a> focused on fault tolerance and performance within distributed file systems. This involved virtual and physical deployment of cluster nodes on a custom Ubuntu 18.04  image, logging and monitoring via telegraf, a private subnet for the cluster to be hosted on, Python and Bash scripting for administration plus deployment via virtualbox, access through a ssh tunnel into the university, complete self project management and external feedback of result presentation. The rest of the course covered a range of skills notably programming (Python, Java, Haskell, C++), web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS), networking (OSI model, subnetting), databases (postgreSQL), operating / <a href="https://github.com/jnoc/uni-papers/blob/main/A%20look%20into%20computational%20time%20of%20replication%20enabled%20on%20a%20distributed%20file%20system.pdf">distributed systems</a> (design, hierarchy), cyber security (hacking, authentication, cryptography),  data structures and algorithms, theoretical computer science and other final year optional modules which touched on <a href="https://github.com/jnoc/uni-papers/blob/main/Cluster%20ambience%20monitoring.pdf">IoT</a> (Docker, external monitoring, C++) and <a href="https://github.com/jnoc/uni-papers/blob/main/COVID-19:%20Simulated%20robots%20to%20pick%20items%20due%20to%20workforce%20shortage%20in%20the%20retail%20sector.pdf">robotics</a> (Lua).</p>
        <h4><u>University of Gothenburg</u> <span class="colour">-</span> <em>Summer School for Sustainability</em></h4>
        <h5>JUL 2022 - AUG 2022 <span class="colour">/</span> Göteborg <span class="colour">/</span> SWE</h5>
        <p>Pass - 7.5 ECTS credits gained in the course: digitalization in a changing world.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>This course focused on bringing sustainability practices into technology but also your own lifestyle. Linked into the global goals 3, 9 and 11 (<a href="https://globalgoals.org/">globalgoals.org</a>)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><u>St. Andrew’s School</u> <span class="colour">-</span> <em>GCE A-Level & GCSE</em></h4>
        <h5>SEP 2016 - JUN 2018 <span class="colour">/</span> Leatherhead <span class="colour">/</span> UK</h5>
        
        <h2><i class="fas fa-clipboard-list"></i>Experience<span class="colour">.</span></h2>
        <h4><u>Epsilon</u> <span class="colour">-</span> <em>Associate Client Integration Engineer</em></h4>
        <h5>APR 2023 - PRESENT <span class="colour">/</span> London <span class="colour">/</span> UK</h5>

        <h4><u>Specsavers</u> <span class="colour">-</span> <em>Administrator & Optical Assistant</em></h4>
        <h5>JAN 2023 - APR 2023 <span class="colour">/</span> Leatherhead <span class="colour">/</span> UK</h5>
        <p>A variety of tasks in both customer facing and optical administration. Such as triaging customers in person, over the phone, updating and filing records, sending out correspondence and processing invoices with payments to corporate and NHS standards. All whilst being able to prioritise tasks efficiently to meet a changing workload with accurate attention to detail. Customer satisfaction is an utmost priority for this role which requires each individual case to be handled with care, professionalism and confidentiality.</p>

        <h4><u>Industrial Light & Magic (Lucasfilm)</u> <span class="colour">-</span> <em>Technical Support Intern</em></h4>
        <h5>AUG 2020 - AUG 2021 <span class="colour">/</span> London <span class="colour">/</span> UK</h5>
        <p>The role was focused on providing system support (Red Hat 8, MacOS, Windows 10), hardware support and monitoring (AMD, Intel, Nvidia, Dell, HP, Zabbix), server hardware and networking support (Dell EMC/ESXi/Isilon, Supermicro, HP, AVID, AP), switch patching and firmware upgrading (Brocade, SFP, QSFP, DWDM, fibre-optic modes, ethernet), VPN/Firewall troubleshooting and user setup support (Pulsesecure, Fortinet). Other tasks included travelling to on set locations to provide on hand support for client filming shoots (Pinewood studio, Chiswick park). Specifically special work for ABBA Voyage which required a completely new custom approach that the client was specifically after.</p>
        <p>Notably in the role I and another intern were tasked with relocating the company's UK render farm (1000+ nodes) to a new data centre. This required pre-cabling, decommissioning and recommissioning of servers and switch stacks, along with stripping out the original cablework. This was a project managed by the department in which they checked in weekly for progress updates. High liability, with complex challenges and management of time was at stake due to working with critical infrastructure supporting projects worth muli-millions in value.</p>
        <p>Another inhouse task required me to set up a <a href="https://github.com/jnoc/winpe-environment">WinPE environment</a> to automate specific Intel port firmware upgrades of the office computers (IntelME). I added onto the existing work which were multiple Python based scripts with references to specific machine installers and deployed it in house for the IT support team.</p>
        <p>Day to day support differed by working in many environments at the same time. Client, employee or department facing jobs (remote and in person) required precise delivery, non-technical and technical communication, confidentiality (due to the industry), integrity, responsibility and security when conducting this role.</p>
        
        <h4><u>Blue Chilli Group</u> <span class="colour">-</span> <em>Work Experience</em></h4>
        <h5>JUN 2019 (1 Week) <span class="colour">/</span> Birmingham <span class="colour">/</span> UK</h5>
        <p>During the week at Blue Chilli the focus was on learning how a developer in a small firm manages what they do along with what they have to overcome as both a front and backend developer.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Within this week, I marked up an HTML front web page with <u>Bootstrap</u> to very specific requirements directly from a mockup image, as well as programming a bursary calculator in <u>PHP</u> which as a language I was not familiar with. I completed both of these tasks and the backend PHP code is being used by the firm to deliver a product to the client.</li>
        </ul>

        </ul>
        <h4><u>Scouts</u> <span class="colour">-</span> <em>Assistant Leader</em></h4>
        <h5>SEP 2015 - AUG 2018 (Seasonal) <span class="colour">/</span> Fetcham <span class="colour">/</span> UK</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Enrolled as an assistant leader to help with management of the scout group, this has involved adding key assets to improve the fluidity of the meetings and acting as a <u>role model</u> for young people.</li>
            <li>With this the responsibility of appropriate language and behaviour within the environment is essential towards being a great <u>mentor</u>.</li>

        <h4><u>Skiing</u></h4>
        <p>My long time passion has been skiing, first started out when I was 4 and then returned to it around the age of 13. I have around 7 weeks of being physically on the snow whilst being taught via instructors and love the atmosphere of being free to glide down the slope. I have skied in resorts in Switzerland, Austria and Bulgaria.</p>
        <h4><u>Photography and Solo Travel</u></h4>
        <p>When I can, I will take my camera with me on my travels. I enjoy taking photos of landscapes rather than people. Most of the techniques that I use when capturing photos have come from my A-Level course and practice. When travelling around Europe and parts of Canada I was able to capture both digital and film, these can be seen on the <a href="/travel/">travel page</a>.</p>
        <h4><u>Camping / Outdoors</u></h4>
        <p>At a young age I was introduced to camping, it has been a part of how I think since then. I joined the local scout troop and would go camping at every opportunity that arose. I try to have some form of trip within the year on weekends where I go out of my way to either go on a hike or a journey that involves the use of a tent. I have walked up mountains across England, Wales, Switzerland and Austria.</p>
