        <h2><i class="fas fa-mountain"></i>Hobbies and Interests<span class="colour">.</span></h2>
        <h4><u>Skiing</u></h4>
        <p>My long time passion has been skiing, first started out when I was 4 and then returned to it around the age of 13. I have around 7 weeks of being physically on the snow whilst being taught via instructors and love the atmosphere of being free to glide down the slope. I have skied in resorts such as Zell am Ziller, Kaltenbach, Mayrhofen, Hochfügen (Austria) and Bansko (Bulgaria).</p>
        <h4><u>Photography</u></h4>
        <p>When I can, I will take my camera with me on my travels. I enjoy taking photos of landscapes rather than people. Most of the techniques that I use when capturing photos has come from my A-Level course and practice. Some places that I have captured images of include; London, Kew, Bansko (Bulgaria), Lake District, Chamonix (France).</p>
        <h4><u>Camping / Outdoors</u></h4>
        <p>At a young age I was introduced to camping, it has been a part of how I think since then. I joined the local scout troop and would go camping at every opportunity that arose. I try to have some form of trip within the year on weekends where I go out of my way to either go on a hike or a journey that involves the use of a tent. I have walked up both Scafell pike and Pen y Fan along with camping in England and Wales.</p>
